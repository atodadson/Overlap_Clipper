about=This plugin helps clean overlapping polygon features in a layer. It detects polygons that intersect and clips them so that no overlaps remain. Users can choose whether to process only the selected features or all features that intersect with the selection. The plugin also allows prioritizing which polygon keeps its shape based on selection order, largest area, or smallest area.
